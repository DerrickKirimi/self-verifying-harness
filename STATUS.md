Update this file at every session checkpoint. Read AGENTS.md first.

## Current milestone: M1 (ingestion and MCP), starting

**M0 has passed; the full MVP is not shipped.** No model calls, ingestion,
agent-generated reproductions/fixes or Harbor trials have been measured. [RUN]

- [RUN] M0 admission: **11/11**, Wilson 95% **[74.12%, 100%]**, meeting the
  10–20-case and lower-bound >=0.70 gate. Proof: `notes/runs/m0-gate.json`.
  Ten GIFs and one silent MOV, all BPMN-js: curated supplied-oracle evidence,
  not speech, model performance or cross-application generalization.
- [RUN] The final replacement, 1928, has now also completed its native oracle:
  pre-fix target assertion fails; post-fix all 1889 executed tests pass with
  unchanged seven skips. The resumed batch (exec session 4399) is terminal.
  It is admitted and included in the frozen eleven-case corpus.
- [CODE/RUN] Admission binds pinned Parquet rows, base commits, source/test patch
  hashes, immutable images, decoded media, manual claim alignment and frozen raw
  log proofs. 1567/1677 fail by runtime exception rather than assertion and stay
  excluded. 1578 passes a supporting invariant but does not directly reproduce
  its broader recorded symptom; archived under `evals/excluded/` (D24).
- [CODE/RUN] `svh freeze-eval` and `load_frozen_corpus` reject incomplete gates,
  overwrites, changed annotations and forged passes on reduced denominators.
  All **54 harness tests pass** under patched pytest 9.1.1. Frozen manifest:
  `evals/frozen-m0.json`; identity `6910fdad889ce36a359981d16ac76c789f5e236eac3556cd3e159112945bad1d`.
- [SRC/INF] First harness selected: deepagents 0.7.28 and official MCP SDK 2.3.0,
  with a thin tool bridge. Released LangChain MCP adapters require MCP <2 and
  are not selected. The selected dependency stack is installed; verify actual HTTP and
  capability interoperability. `notes/2026-10-20-harness-selection.md`, D25.
- [CODE/SRC] Authorized Gemini credentials remain in the external private file
  named by gitignored `.env`; never print or commit keys/screenshots/account IDs.
  Private local API cap is $4.00, below the supplied prepaid balance. Persistent
  `svh.budget` reservations are tested, but no model transport is wired yet.
  Include reasoning/summarization calls, retain ambiguous charges and disable
  retries before any paid request. `notes/2026-10-20-gemini-access.md`.
- [RUN/SRC] Host and fixture sandbox use pytest 9.1.1 after three GitHub alerts
  for CVE-2025-71176. All three original frozen fixture checks still fail before
  and pass after: 3/3, Wilson 95% [43.85%, 100%]. New proof:
  `notes/runs/fixture-oracle-pytest9.json`; default image promoted after checks.
  Remote alert closure was still pending at last read. Details in
  `notes/2026-10-20-pytest-upgrade.md`.
- [SRC/INF] Owner-requested side-agent literature review is completed and pushed:
  `docs/literature-review.md`. GUIRepair, ViBR, Framesleuth, direct Multimodal
  successors and CoHarden inform design; no external system was executed.
- [INF] M1–M3 prospective acceptance and shipping evidence are fixed before model
  measurements in `evals/PROTOCOL.md` (D26). Reference projects, embedders and
  storage choices are replaceable. Docker is current; no cloud migration needed.

## Next concrete steps

1. Curation is complete and frozen. Do not restart either terminal Docker batch.
   M0 now passes on all eleven admitted cases; use the frozen manifest in M1.
2. Install/pin the selected MCP/deepagents/Gemini stack. Demonstrate HTTP tools,
   resources, prompts, structured/image results and server-owned trusted inputs.
3. Cover the complete model transport, including implicit middleware calls, with
   the persistent cost guard. Disable retries/delegation for the first baseline.
   Verify sandbox boundaries before generated code or paid model use.
4. Build ingestion/retrieval and measure M1 against the fixed-frame baseline,
   then proceed through M2 claims/checkpoints and M3 generated check/fix, held-out
   regressions, wrong-fix controls and actual Harbor oracle/nop trials.

## Evidence and history

- Original intent: `docs/idea/` (never edit); analysis/roadmap/decisions/references:
  `docs/`. Source release and audit: `notes/2026-10-20-swebench-multimodal-pilot.md`.
- Native execution reports: `notes/runs/native/`; admitted immutable proof
  metadata: `notes/runs/proofs/`; raw media/rows/logs/gold patches stay ignored in
  `data/external/`. Manual reviews: `evals/reviews.json`.
- Reproduction, resume and fresh-clone commands:
  `notes/2026-10-20-external-admission.md`. The pilot log-path resume bug is fixed
  and its report now regrades correctly; historical proof snapshots are intact.
- Earlier bootstrap/fixture work: `notes/2026-10-20-m0-checkpoint.md`, fixture
  app commits `426a532` and `eee15eb`. Fixture-only success did not pass M0.
